# üì¶ Missing Component Detection using YOLOv8 with PyQt GUI

## üßæ Introduction
This project aims to automate the process of detecting missing components in industrial hardware assemblies using a YOLOv8-based object detection system. A PyQt5 GUI has been developed to provide an intuitive interface for uploading images, running detections, and generating traceable outputs such as QR codes and Excel reports. This project was implemented as part of a 6-month internship at Senworx.

## üéØ Objectives
- To develop a real-time object detection model using YOLOv8 for identifying key hardware components.
- To create a PyQt5 GUI that allows users to upload single/batch images and visualize detection results.
- To generate alphanumeric IDs and QR codes for traceability.
- To export detection results and missing component reports to Excel files.
- To visualize batch-level trends using bar and pie charts.
